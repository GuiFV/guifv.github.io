														<h3>And the award I received for it</h3>
													</header>
													<p>The theater sector was suffering from a lack of public communication in Rio de Janeiro. And to make things worst, newspapers
														and magazines were not listing plays on their publications. I decided to create an app that producers could publicize
														their plays for free and users could check plays info and even buy tickets on the app. Now, the "Aplicativo Teatro Brasil" was born.
														We advertised premium spaces in the app for plays that would pay for such positions. It was a great tool.
														But unfortunately the sector was not mature enough to go with us, and we eventually had to close doors. In the meantime,
														the most prestigious theater event in the state awarded us in the Special
														Category for the app. and as I accepted the paid award I said "My mom is an actress and my father worked with computers.
														I think it was my fate to build this app".
